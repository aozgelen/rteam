Introduction:
    This library was created for the MetroBotics project at CUNY. Its purpose is
    to provide a framework of commonly used classes and functions that aid in
    the development of artificial intelligence and robotics applications.


Installation:
    1. Run 'make' to build the library, or 'make DEBUG=0' to build the library
       without any debugging information included (e.g. release version).
    2. Run 'make install' to install the headers and library files into
       the MetroUtil/include and MetroUtil/lib directories.
    3. Run 'make docs' to install the documentation files into the MetroUtil/doc
       directory.


Usage:
    1. Include the metrobotics.h header file into your source code.
            Ex: #include "metrobotics.h"
    2. All classes and functions in the library exist within the metrobotics
       namespace.
            Ex: using namespace metrobotics;
    3. Link the libMetrobotics.a library file into your project.
            Ex: g++ foo.cpp -IMetroUtil/include -LMetroUtil/lib -lMetrobotics
    4. Alternatively, include and link only the sub-components that you are
       using in your project.
    5. Read the documentation for information on how to use the library's
       classes and functions.
