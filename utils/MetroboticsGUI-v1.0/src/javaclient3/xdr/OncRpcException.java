/**
 * The class <code>OncRpcException</code> indicates ONC/RPC conditions
 * that a reasonable application might want to catch. We follow here the
 * notation established by the Java environment that exceptions can be
 * caught while errors usually can't. Because we don't want to throw our
 * applications out of the virtual machine (should I mock here "out of the
 * window"?), we only define exceptions.
 *
 * <p>The class <code>OncRpcException</code> also defines a set of ONC/RPC
 * error codes as defined by RFC 1831. Note that all these error codes are
 * solely used on the client-side or server-side, but never transmitted
 * over the wire. For error codes transmitted over the network, refer to
 * OncRpcAcceptStatus and OncRpcRejectStatus.
