/**
 * The abstract base class <code>XdrUnion</code> helps (de-)serializing
 * polymorphic classes. This class should not be confused with C unions in
 * general. Instead <code>XdrUnion</code> is an object-oriented construct
 * which helps in deploying polymorphism. For examples on how to use this,
 * please take a look at the "ACPLTea Java Library" package, which is also
 * available from <code>www.acplt.org/ks</code>. As a sidenote, the
 * serialization scheme implemented by <code>XdrUnion</code> is only a question
 * of getting used to it: after serializing the type code of the polymorphic
 * class, the variant part is serialized first before the common part. This
 * behaviour stems from the ACPLT C++ Communication Library and has been
 * retained for compatibility reasons. As it doesn't hurt, you won't mind
 * anyway.
 *
 * <p>To use polymorphism with XDR streams, you'll have to derive your own base
 * class (let's call it <code>foo</code> from <code>XdrUnion</code>
 * and implement the two methods
 * {@link #xdrEncodeCommon(XdrEncodingStream)} and
 * {@link #xdrDecodeCommon(XdrDecodingStream)}. Do not overwrite
 * the methods xdrEncode and xdrDecode!
 *
 * <p>Then, in your <code>foo</code>-derived classes, like <code>bar</code>
 * and <code>baz</code>, implement the other two methods
 * {@link #xdrEncodeVariant(XdrEncodingStream)} and
 * {@link #xdrDecodeVariant(XdrDecodingStream)}. In addition, implement
 * {@link #getXdrTypeCode} to return an int, uniquely identifying your
 * class. Note that this identifier only needs to be unique within the scope
 * of your <code>foo</code> class.
