The RobotController is a generic hardware agent in the R-Team multi-robot
platform developed for the MetroBotics project at CUNY.

Build the controller:
    1. Run 'make' to build the controller, or 'make DEBUG=0' to build it
       without any debugging information included (e.g. release version).

Using the controller:
    1. Run the Player server.
    2. Ensure a Central server is running.
    3. Run the controller.
